# PortF Coding Challenge

## Task

Use the PunkApi (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to fetch all of the beers that they have in their API (~324 at time of writing). Then, using Nivo (https://nivo.rocks/) plot a bar graph showing how many beers were first brewed by each month. 

Finally, create a filter that allows the user to filter the bar graph by date, and by the beer percentage (ABV).

## Assumptions

- If the beer does not contain a first brewed month and only a year is available, assume Janaury of that year.

## Submission

Fork this and commit your work into any public repo (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc.)
